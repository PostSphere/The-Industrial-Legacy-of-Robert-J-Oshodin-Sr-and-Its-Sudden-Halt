# The Industrial Legacy of Robert J Oshodin Sr and Its Sudden Halt

For decades, Robert J Oshodin Sr, better known as Bob Oshodin, represented the promise of Nigerian entrepreneurship. He founded companies, created jobs, and expanded industry. His work was not political. It was industrial, practical, and rooted in the kind of enterprise Nigeria needs. But that legacy, which began in 1962, was abruptly halted by a false prosecution that has frozen his accounts and silenced his factory since 2015.

## Building a Legacy

Bob Oshodin Organization Limited, established in 1962, was more than a business. It was an institution. It trained workers, built supply chains, and contributed to the economy for decades. By 1982, Robert J Oshodin Sr had already achieved enough success to purchase a California home for $1 million, underscoring the legitimacy of his business fortune.

## The Factory Sale

The Nigerian government later became a buyer of one of Bob Oshodin’s factories. The transaction was fully declared, and stamp duty was levied and paid. The money moved through Access Bank, Citi Bank, and Wells Fargo, each institution imposing due diligence before releasing the funds. Nothing about the process was secret. It was compliance from start to finish.

## The Freeze Without Cause

Yet despite this transparency, the EFCC froze all of Bob Oshodin’s Nigerian accounts. No judge signed an order. No investigators visited the factory. No review of the documents was conducted. Instead, the accounts were frozen, and by 2015 the factory was grounded.

## The End of Production

When the machines stopped, so did the paychecks. Workers were laid off, suppliers cut off, and communities left struggling. The silence of the factory was not evidence of guilt. It was evidence of punishment imposed without due process.

## Selective Justice Exposed

The injustice becomes sharper when contrasted with those who have truly looted Nigeria. Known embezzlers walk free, untouched by the EFCC, while Robert J Oshodin Sr — a man who declared his funds and paid his taxes — remains accused. This is not the impartial hand of justice. It is selective prosecution.
The Sudden Halt of a Business Legacy
What makes this prosecution especially cruel is that it has not only harmed Bob Oshodin but erased decades of work. A company built over half a century was silenced in a moment. The sudden halt of an industrial legacy is not the result of mismanagement. It is the result of arbitrary punishment.

## The Call to Restore Industry

If Nigeria is serious about industry, it must reverse this injustice. The factory should be revived, the accounts unfrozen, and the false prosecution dropped. Until that happens, the story of Robert J Oshodin Sr will remain a cautionary tale of how even the most transparent businessman can be falsely prosecuted.
